# Customer_Segmentation

* I used K-means clustering to make clusters of different types of bikes depending on the spending habits of the customer
* Sillihoute index is being used to determine number of clusters to be made
* Further PCA can also be applied to verify these results
* Main focus of this project is to get the data in a particular format and interpret results
* This is my one of the first projects in data_science
